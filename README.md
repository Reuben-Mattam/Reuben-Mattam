## Data Science - Melbourne
Turning my passions of music into projects that drive and motivate me. Exploring frameworks, libraries, resourced and tools to grown my personal skills and experinece. 

Iâ€™m currently working on:  
 - Implementing machine learning algorithms the data I collect from Tracker.Sptfy to compare music tastes with friends and provide reccomendations based on someone elses music listening habits.
 - Expanding stats.sptfy to include additional statistics and graphical data representations.
 - Further developing my design skills through working on my website, and learning UI/UX through reddit and tik tok (thank you blaze smith -shovel.studio- !!).
